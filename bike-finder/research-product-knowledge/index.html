<h4>Questions</h4>
<ul>
    <li>What do I want to do on my bicycle?</li>
    <ul><li>i.e. commute, weekend riding, sport</li></ul>
    <li>Where do I want to go?</li>
    <ul><li>i.e. on-road, off-road, the beach</li></ul>
    <li>How much time/skill do I have looking after a bike?</li>
    <ul><li>i.e. expensive bikes have expensive maintenance</li></ul>
</ul>

<h4>Price and Quality</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Price depends on priorities, terrain, and intended use</li>
    <li>A good-quality basic bike with disc brakes and multiple gears can range from $600 to $900</li>
    <li>Quality e-bikes start at $1,200 to $1,300</li>
</ul>

<h4>Types of Bicycles</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comfort Bikes:</strong> Leisurely riding on pavement with high handlebars and comfortable features</li>
    <li><strong>Road and Gravel Bikes:</strong> For speed, long mileage, and varied terrain</li>
    <li><strong>Mountain Bikes:</strong> Designed for rugged trails with durable construction and off-road handling</li>
    <li><strong>Fitness Bikes:</strong> Blend of road and gravel frames, suitable for commuting and lighter workouts</li>
    <li><strong>Folding Bikes:</strong> Compact and portable, suitable for commuters and easy storage</li>
    <li><strong>Electric Bikes:</strong> Battery and motor-equipped bikes with various styles, e-bikes are heavier (50-60 pounds)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Frame Size</h4>

<h4>Bike Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Less expensive bikes may have cable-actuated disc brakes, while pricier models often have hydraulically actuated discs. Disc brakes are strongly recommended for new bike purchases, especially for improved wet-weather performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> A bicycle's drivetrain consists of the chain, which runs between the crankset (near the pedals) and the cassette attached to the rear hub. Recent trends include the expansion of rear cassette sizes, with some bikes featuring up to 12-speed clusters.</li>
    <li><strong>Shifters:</strong> Many bikes, especially electric, gravel, cruiser, and comfort bikes, now feature a single shifter due to the absence of front gears. Various styles of shifters include twist devices, triggers, and lever shifters on drop-bar bikes.</li>
    <li><strong>Handlebars:</strong> Handlebars and stems can be swapped to enhance riding position by adjusting height and grip. High-rise handlebars enable a fairly upright sitting position. Conventional road bikes feature curved drop bars, promoting an aerodynamic, fully bent position.</li>
    <li><strong>Saddle:</strong> Don't automatically accept the default saddle that comes with a bike; ensure it fits your body as it bears most of your weight during rides. An improper fit can lead to discomfort or pain, making bike rides less enjoyable; investing in a fitting session is advisable. Cruisers may feature wider, softer saddles for comfort, even if it reduces responsiveness. Performance-oriented bikes may have narrower or harder saddles for quicker adjustments in corners.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Materials</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Steel:</strong> It's a more traditional, staple material for bikes. They are comfortable, strong, and durable. Steel is easy to repair because dents and bends can be hammered out easily. It's also affordable. But, it can rust faster than aluminum and is generally heavier than other materials.</li>
    <li><strong>Aluminum:</strong> It's naturally lightweight and stiff and not prone to rust. But, the stiffness makes it less comfortable. They usually have wider tubes which makes them weaker.</li>
    <li><strong>Carbon fiber:</strong> It's lightweight and stiff and a non-metal. It can be manipulated into aerodynamic shapes and fine tuned for pinpointed stiffness and strength. They are also becoming more affordable, but are still somewhat expensive. It's also hard to repair.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Extra Considerations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Test riding before purchasing is preferred</li>
    <li>There are various options for customization with grips, pedals, and saddles but may come at an additional cost</li>
    <li>Extra features like a bell, lights, rack, and helmet should be considered for extra safety and lifestyle compatability</li>
    <li>Bikes can be an investment</li>
    <li>Where you buy your bike can determine the quality. Big box stores don't have bike-specialized staff and offer cheap bikes. Non-reputable online sellers don't offer the same in-person experience and can be spotty on quality. Bike-specific retailers can offer a more tailored experience and repair services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Online Shopping Experience</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/bikes/1081404">Walmart</a></h3>

<ul>
    <li>Has own bike-specific home page with so many different options for all ages. Also, features bike accessories like helmets, water bottles, and locks.</li>
    <li>I specifically am interested in commuter, adult bikes. Inside the commuter bike results you can filter them through options on the left side.</li>
    <ul><li>The filters have options exclusive to bikes like bicycle type, number of speeds, and materials in addition to more general ones like customer rating and color.</li></ul>
    <li>The product images don't have any hover states. So, in order to see any extra product details, it directs you to a new page.</li>
    <li>On the product page it has the typical features like more product images, description, and similar items with the add to cart section on the right. However, it also includes a comparison table, which allows the user to compare and contrast bicycles. It compares: brand, bicycle type, wheel diameter, age group, number of speeds, color, and frame material.</li>
    <li>There's a wide price range, with the lowest being $148 and highest being $1,100 for commuter bikes.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/">Trek</a></h3>

<ul>
    <li>This is a bike-only retailer, and it's navigation is more tailored to that with it being sorted my bike type, parts, accessory, apparel, and age.</li>
    <li>I'm specifically looking at urban and commuter bikes. The filter is also on the left side with majority bike-specific filters like suspension, brake type, frame material, wheel size along with more general ones like price and color.</li>
    <li>All of the product imagery feels like its from the same place and follows the same format, allowing for better visual comparison.</li>
    <li>There's no hover over add to cart feature on the results page. However, you can add them to a comparison feature, which allows to you compare up to for bikes by their price, model number, color, rating, description, tech specs, wheels, and components. It's much more in-depth than Walmart's.</li>
    <li>The product page is more detailed giving you seperate tabs for things like features, specs, and sizing, and it allows you to customize through color and size.</li>
    <li>The shopping cart is pretty typical with it showing what you've put in the cart and expected total cost.</li>
    <li>Prices are definitely more towards the expensive side.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
What big questions will a buyer will be faced with? 
<ul>
    <li>Buyers will need to figure out why they need a bike, their budget, their willingness for maintenance, and their desired comfort and fit. They'll also need to determine the best place for them to buy a bike. Buyers should also consider extra additions like water bottles and helmets along with modifications to the bike like a new saddle or handlebar.</li>
</ul>
What priorities might they have? 
<ul>
    <li>Buyers might prioritize their intentions for biking, budget and time constraints, and brand reputability when making a purchase. They also would want an easy and navigable shopping experience where they feel well-education and supported with their purchase.</li>
</ul>
What did you run into that you didn't understand, and now you do?
<ul>
    <li>I didn't really understand all the different materials and components and how they each impact a bike's comfort and performance. After looking at different guides to buying a bike, I now understand what makes each factor compelling to various rider's. I also never took into consideration sizing when it came to choosing a bicycle. Seeing the measurment chart really simplified knowing which bikes would fit me.</li>
