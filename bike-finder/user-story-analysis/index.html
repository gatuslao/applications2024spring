        Analysis
    </h1>

    <p>We want to emphasize customization and filtering on our site. A majority of user stories highlighted personalization for comfort and cycling purposes as one of their main priorities. Most users are coming to the site with a set type of bike in mind and we want to build our site around helping them navigate towards their desired product. Of course, some users outside of our user stories will have a more generalized idea of what they want. In this case, we will also include information about the bike's features both at a glance on the product result page and more in-depth on the product's own page.</p>
