    What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and configuring the specific
    product?
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Top navigation bar:</strong> When you hover over one of the categories it reveals more subcategories
            that relate to the main one. You can really narrow your search though that ability.</li>
        <li><strong>Filters/chips:</strong> You can further narrow your search through filters above the product images.
            There are pictured categories (i.e. stud, hoop, statement, etc.) and more traditional filters below that
            with check boxes on basic jewelry shopping characteristics like materials and price.</li>
        <li><strong>Hover states:</strong> When you hover over the picture, it brings up a condensed version of the
            product page where you can click through pictures and add to cart.</li>
        <li><strong>Product page:</strong> The product page has a more basic view at the top, featuring simple imagery,
            description, and add to cart button. As you scroll down, it becomes more detailed, describing the collection
            it’s a part of and highlighting similar products the consumer might be interested in.</li>
        <li><strong>Add to cart:</strong> When you click to add to cart, a sidebar opens showing what product you added
            and it encourages you to check out. The bag in the right hand corner turns blue and shows you the number of
            items in it. The Shopping Bag page features the product you added and an order summary, estimating tax and
            delivery. Below, it also shows other products you might also like.</li>
    </ul>
    Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?
    <ul>
        <li>Yes, I’ve seen all these features on websites, especially fashion websites. It makes window shopping easier
            and an actual sale more possible. Everything pushes you towards finding what you need and more through
            filters and extra suggestions.</li>
    </ul>
    Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?
    <ul>
        <li>Yes, I’ve interacted with and encountered all these elements before on precious websites. And even if they
            looked different (i.e. the Tiffany bag instead of the traditional basket/cart), I knew what they were
            because of the placement on the page.</li>
    </ul>
    What general problem is this element designed to handle?
    <ul>
        <li>It’s designed to help the user buy products they need and then some. Each element works to usher them
            towards checkout and paying.</li>
    </ul>
    Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?
    <ul>
        <li>Tiffany’s website’s main goal is to make a sale. Through using familiar navigation, pertinent filters, extra
            shopping suggestions, and clearly emphasized buttons, they guide the user towards buying.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        <a href="https://www.converse.com/">Converse</a>
    </h3>
    What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and configuring the specific
    product?
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Top navigation bar:</strong> From hovering over the menu items, I can see subcategories to further
            narrow my search.</li>
        <li><strong>Filters/chips:</strong> The filters are on the left side and are a little awkward to scroll through,
            but can be hidden. Users can choose from a myriad of filters ranging from shoe style to what’s trending.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hover states:</strong> Hovering over the product images gives a different view to the show and also
            shows other available colors. An add to cart button is also revealed and when clicked the sizing remains in
            the hover area.</li>
        <li><strong>Product page:</strong> The product page features simple product imagery along with actual pictures
            of purchasers and reviews. You can pick a size and add to cart.</li>
        <li><strong>Add to cart:</strong> When the add to cart button is clicked, it opens a sidebar that shows what
            you’ve just added and the estimated delivery. The cart icon on the right upper corner shows the number of
            items in it. The checkout button is emphasized through color. On the Your Cart page, it features what’s in
            the cart and a cart summary on the right with the total costs.</li>
    </ul>
    Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?
    <ul>
        <li>Yes, especially in the context of fashion websites. Using filters and visual language like this, makes
            shopping easier and more efficient.</li>
    </ul>
    Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?
    <ul>
        <li>Yes, the Converse website plays off of what others have done for sure. Everything, except the filters, was
            where I expected it to be and had the look I’m used to seeing.</li>
    </ul>
    What general problem is this element designed to handle?
    <ul>
        <li>All the elements are designed to direct the user towards making a purchase.</li>
    </ul>
    Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?
    <ul>
        <li>It was used in a commercial context and it was successful. From using convention, Converse makes a mostly
            pain free shopping process, ensuring that the typical user knows how to get from point a to point b.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        <a href="https://www.yeti.com/">Yeti</a>
    </h3>
    What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and configuring the specific
    product?
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Top navigation bar:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>At full width there are broad categories in the navigation bar that reveal more subcategories when you hover over them</li>
                <li>At a certain breakpoint, the navigation bar changes to have more specific options and has a horizontal scroll</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Filters/chips:</strong> filter categories with plus sign button next to each that have a drop down when you click on them to show specifics (example: Color category drops down to show the different available colors)</li>
        <li><strong>Hover states</strong></li>
        <li><strong>After specific type of bottle is selected:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Thumbnails of different colors</li>
                <li>Buttons with different sizes</li>
                <li>Related products you can also add to cart</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>After adding to cart:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Section with added item swipes in from right of the screen</li>
                <li>Cart or “Your Bag” in this case had element to add your zip code for estimated shipping cost</li>
                <li>On right side of the page had “Order Summary” with shipping cost, estimated total, and checkout button.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?
    <ul>
        <li>I have seen the top navigation bar in many websites, not just online stores</li>
        <li>I have seen hover state animations on photos in portfolio websites as well</li>
        <li>Drop down menus are a common element of many websites’ navigation system</li>
    </ul>
    Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?
    <ul>
        <li>I knew what to do with many of the elements I listed before I interacted with it because I encountered similar features many times before in other websites.</li>
    </ul>
    What general problem is this element designed to handle?
    <ul>
        <li>The navigation bar with many subcategories and filters are designed to handle the general problem of different users having different preferences and therefore wanting a way to easily find results that they would want while still keeping all the options available for all users.</li>
        <li>The hover states on pictures can have many different purposes, but a common problem it handles is showing different aspects of the page the picture is linked to without making the user click the link immediately.</li>
    </ul>
    Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?
    <ul>
        <li>The navigation system is used in this context to help consumers easily find specific Yeti products while keeping all options open for consumers who are unsure about exactly what they want or if they want a Yeti product at all. </li>
        <li>The hover states on pictures in this context is used to show a different angle of the specific Yeti product.</li>
        <li>These elements are successful.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Individual Summary</h2>
    What elements or patterns seem universal?
    <ul>
        <li>There's always a top nav bar with general menu items and then when you hover over one of them it reveals more specific categories. A cart icon is also present at the top right hand corner. On the results page, you can filter your search through check boxes. When you hover over product images, it leads to a condensed version of the product page, allowing you to view simple info and add to cart without leaving the results page. The cart page always has a similiar setup with cart contents on the left side and an order summary on the right side.</li>
    </ul>
    Did I see anything that felt different or unusual?
    <ul>
        <li>The Converse filter area was vertically on the left side. You had to scroll down it to see all the options but sometimes trying to scroll down the filters would cause you to scroll down the results page. So, that was a little clunky. Converse would also have self-advertisements fit in-between the product grid on the results page, which took me out of the shopping experience. The Tiffany & Co. website has a lot of animations which I'd never seen on other retail shops. It was a little distracting at times.</li>
    </ul>
    What elements or patterns were specific to the store or product?
    <ul>
        <li>Tiffany's had a shopping bag, reminiscent of the famous Tiffany shopping bag, instead of a cart and everything was accented by the Tiffany blue color. It also had jewlery-specific navigation and filters, just like how Converse has shoe-specific filters.</li>
    </ul>
    Were there any patterns or techniques that made one store stand out? Could the other stores have applied that technique successfully?
    <ul>
        <li>I really liked how Tiffany's handled the hover-over concise product page technique. When hovered over, you can flip through multiple pictures and easily add to cart, whereas Yeti and Converse didn't have the option to click-through multiple pictures and the add to cart button was placed over the product imagery. Tiffany's approach felt cleaner than the others'</li>
    </ul>
    Finally, how did you feel when interacting with these sites? When were you happiest/most comfortable? When were you disrupted/confused/bothered?
    <ul>
        I was happiest when I knew what was going on and when I could predict what was going to happen next. I was confused and bothered when things didn't go my way, like when I tried scrolling down Converse filters and ended up scrolling down the whole page.
    </ul>
